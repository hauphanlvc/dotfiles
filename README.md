## dotfiles

- Neovim config, but I don't use any plugins.
- i3 VM config.
- Awesome VM config, but I changed to use i3 instead of Awesome. Because i3 is simple than awesome.
- Minimal tmux config which can be used anywhere else.
- And, hmm, maybe in the future I will add to the new configs

NOTE: useful-scripts is just a folder that can be used by me, so don't care about this folder
